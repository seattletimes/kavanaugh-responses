I have found a healthy way to move forward and feel less like it is solely my fault, through the public testimonies of others who have been more courageous than I. That has been both challenging and comforting. I have moved on from those experiences and now live a mostly happy, healthy life with meaningful relationships with others. Very recently, an individual from college reached out to me saying that watching the Kavanaugh hearing encouraged him to reach out to me. He proceeded to give a very descriptive instance of when he clearly acted inappropriately with me, and for that, he was apologetic. While I appreciate the apology, it brought back some unpleasant memories and made me wonder what he was apologizing for. Because he was genuinely sorry and embarrassed? Or because he wanted his own peace of mind?",

Then, out of left field, an over-aged Democrat senator hauls out a 30-year-old memory of the judge doing stupid sort-of sexual stuff.

And what is that development? Millions of men have been educated in the most powerful of forums that yes, millions of girls and women are in fact treated as if their bodies are somebody else’s property, and they carry the scars to prove it. A critical mass of men are learning that this is a big problem and their gender is responsible. Finally, and most importantly, women are finally taking on a major obstacle in the long slog to equality: The usually subtle but lingering notion — rooted in the days of women as property — that a man is entitled to a woman’s body.

It’s clear that people on both sides of the firestorm think that extending the presumption of innocence to one side means taking it away from the other. When I was a kid, I was raped repeatedly by my babysitter, every weekend, for a year. As a man, I was also blamed and shut down a bit when I brought it up with my father. My mom believed me, but it was too late to really do anything about it, and I dealt with it on my own through counseling and taking hallucinogens with my friends. I personally think there is a point where you have to move on, and get over it. No amount of criminal litigation will actually fix it. On the other hand, seeing our system continue to push a bias that denies victims the opportunity to safely and effectively confront rapist just disgusts me. While I don't think Kavanaugh is fit to sit on the Supreme Court, I agree with the notion that his juvenile offenses are not relevant to who he is today. I don't believe in permanent records for juvenile offenders, even rapists and murders. What I don't agree with is not actively launching an investigation into what he did when he was in college.
