    "Response": "I think that Ford probably was abused at some point when she was young, however I don't believe Kavanaugh was ever involved in anyway. With that said, I also think that Kavanaugh should recuse himself. Not for any of Ford's or anyone's else's allegations, but everything that he and his family has had to endure, it could maybe have impact on a future similar case. Say a family member of Ford's or any of the left's that tried to crucify him had to appear in front of him? Would he be fair? Maybe? Maybe not? It shouldn't even be a question in anybody's mind.

    "Response": "The judge was not forthcoming. He was highly political. He was emotional and rude. Not good traits for a judge. I'm 78 years old now, but when I was about 40 and working at a private Catholic college as a salaried administrator, the vice president who hired me showed up one night at my apartment, carrying his overnight bag.  He was married; I had known him for 8 years and sat through many committee meetings and small plane flights with him and presidents and other vice presidents.  I stood by the door and told him \"you can't stay, I'll lose my job, maybe you'll lose your job.\" He left. There were no repercussions. I don't remember if I told anyone at the time",

    "Response": "Over the past few years, there have been many instances in my past that I have realized can and should be considered cases of sexual assault and harassment and this has been difficult to come to terms with. I have found a healthy way to move forward and feel less like it is solely my fault, through the public testimonies of others who have been more courageous than I. That has been both challenging and comforting. I have moved on from those experiences and now live a mostly happy, healthy life with meaningful relationships with others. Very recently, an individual from college reached out to me saying that watching the Kavanaugh hearing encouraged him to reach out to me. He proceeded to give a very descriptive instance of when he clearly acted inappropriately with me, and for that, he was apologetic. While I appreciate the apology, it brought back some unpleasant memories and made me wonder what he was apologizing for. Because he was genuinely sorry and embarrassed? Or because he wanted his own peace of mind?",

    "Response": "Judge Kavanaugh was “well qualified” (American Bar Association) and on his way to confirmation. Then out of left field an over-aged Democrat senator hauls out a 30-year-old memory of the judge doing stupid sort-of sexual stuff. The rest of the Democrats and much of the media pounce and all of a sudden this fine man was vilified. To me it seems a really low way Democrats have chosen to do a character assassination. Then the accuser has major memory lapses. But the political party that doesn’t want a potential 5-4 conservative-liberal court to rule against its desires continues to absolute crush this man’s reputation, ignoring his two young kids. That seems deplorable.",

    "Response": "Upsetting as the Kavanaugh saga is, I’ve tried to take the long view and accept that the arc of justice is long but unstoppable. I see the Kavanaugh hearings and all that surrounds them as a huge development in the women’s rights movement, much bigger even than the reckoning that began with Harvey Weinstein. And what is that development? Millions of men have been educated in the most powerful of forums that yes, millions of girls and women are in fact  treated as if their bodies are somebody else’s property, and they carry the scars to prove it. A critical mass of men are learning that this is a big problem and their gender is responsible. Finally, and most importantly, women are finally taking on a major obstacle in the long slog to equality: The usually subtle but lingering notion —rooted in the days of women as property—that a man is entitled to a woman’s body.

Like most I would always tell myself that it wasn't that bad, worse has happened to others, I wasn't \"raped\", no one will believe me, I shouldn't have put myself in that position, etc. I have only shared my full story with one person, my husband. I have shared that \"something\" happened with my children and closest friends. Even today 30 years later I still feel guilty and ashamed that I let it happen.

The only thing that brings me some hope is that we have survived so far with Clarence Thomas on the court despite Anita Hill's testimony. Personally, I have had an ex-boyfriend threaten to electrocute me and have had to talk to the high school cops about a boy in school who explained in detail to another classmate how he wanted to fuck me so hard that my organs burst and I began vomiting blood. I was stalked by another boy I barely knew, and he proclaimed to everyone that he was in love with me. Despite all of that, I consider myself lucky. I was never physically harmed or assaulted, and I know many young girls who went through much worse. It seemed like every girl had a story to tell. ",
